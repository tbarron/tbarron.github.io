        <h3>$ROOT</h3>

        <p>$ROOT is a shorthand for the directory where the current project's
           files reside on my machine.

        <h3>Directory Layout</h3>

        <p>This is an overview of one way to set up a collection of
           Javascript/CSS/HTML projects. Oftentimes, the recommendation is to
           put all the Javascript files in one directory (often called 'js'),
           all the CSS files in another directory ('css' or 'styles' or the
           like), and all the HTML files in yet another directory ('templates'
           or 'layouts' or some such).

        <p>Setting things up this way forces the developer to constantly be
           jumping from directory to directory and can often make things more
           difficult to find.

        <p>I'm trying a different structure, putting all the files related to a
           particular project together in one directory. So, for example, the
           source for this file, the <a href="../index.html">front page of this
           site</a>, the CSS to format them, and the Javascript for reporting
           each HTML file's last update (see the bottom right corner of this
           page) all live in the same directory, $ROOT/home/.

        <p>Each subproject (Calories Per Pound, Conway's Life, etc. -- see the
           front page) will get its own appropriately named subdirectory which
           will hold all the HTML, CSS, and JS files for that project.

        <h3>Last Update Timestamps</h3>

        <p>Emacs, my favorite editor, has a feature where it will insert the
           current timestamp into the file being edited if a line near the top
           has the form

           <pre>   Updated: <></pre>

           or

           <pre>   Updated: ""</pre>

           The timestamp is inserted when the file is saved, so it provides a
           very precise way of tracking when the file was last updated.

        <p>To exploit this, I have the following at the top of each of my HTML
          files:

          <pre>   &lt;script id="updated">Updated: "TIMESTAMP"&lt;/script>
          </pre>

        <p>In each of my CSS files:

          <pre>   :root {
       --updated: "TIMESTAMP";
   }
</pre>

        <p>And in each of my JS files:

          <pre>   var js_update = "Updated: TIMESTMP"; </pre>

        <p>Finally, I have written a JS function called show_update() and
          arranged for it to be called when the window is loaded.

          <pre>   window.onload = show_update;  </pre>

        <p>If everything is set up properly, when one of my pages is loaded, in
        the right lower corner will appear as display of the dates and times of
        the most recent updates to the HTML, the CSS, and the JS file.

      </div>
      <div id="last_update" class="commit"></div>
  </body>
</html>
