# tbarron.github.io
First attempt at a github pages site

### Next steps ###

 * Fix the issues with doirecv, doisub, doifetch

 * Go back to github and generate the other themes so I can have them
   locally and jump around among them.

 * Copy bookmarks from
   [google bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/),
   [integrel.org pmwiki](http://integrel.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Tom.Bookmarks)
   page into tbarron.github.io/bookmarks.md

 * Hack support for links with a target attribute into markdown. A nice
   feature would be syntax I could put in the markdown file that would say,
   "all the links in this file should have attribute 'target=<blah>'" so
   they could all be changed in one place if desired.
   
 * Incorporate my new markdown processor into jekyll.

 * Move answered questions and completed tasks to a new page named
   done.md (-> done.html)

 * Read about jekyll's post_url tag at
   https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/\#post-url

 * Pasting in emacs 25 is messed up. Every time I paste, the cursor jumps
   to the top of the page and the pasted material winds up someplace I
   don't want it AND it gets mangled. Need to figure this out. I suspect
   some obscure (to me) setting that I need to tweak.

 * TWP's [Chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic) provides a large
   list of test cases for a date parser. I could use this list for testing
   dt. Also, dt should be a library with an interface command, not
   functionality baked into an interface command. The interface command
   should be just enough to allow calling the library from the command
   line.
   
 * Add github pages to backscratcher

 * Add github pages to editor

 * Add github pages to emacs_goodies

 * Add github pages to envy

 * Add github pages to fns

 * Add github pages to githooks

 * Add github pages to gitr

 * Add github pages to spackle

 * Add github pages to tbx

 * Can I tag blog posts in jekyll?

 * Maybe what I really want is to put this list in README.md so it shows up
   near the top of github.com/tbarron/tbarron.github.io and the actual site
   tbarron.github.io is cleaner.
   
 * Learn about drafts in jekyll
 
 * How do I create an anchor to an internal point in a file like I see on
   TWP's site and in the jekyll docs?
 
 * ...
