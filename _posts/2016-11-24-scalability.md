title: Scalability
---

I'm just realizing that doing the same operation across a lot of projects
(eg., adding github pages to each of my projects on github) is an example
of behavior that doesn't scale well. Is there some way I could specify an
operation once and have a software bot then take care of it across a
collection of entities?
