title: A Pages Project
---
I want to set up github pages for my Python Best Practices book project.
Here are the steps:

  * In the github project, under Settings, select "Choose a Theme".
  * Decide which theme to use and select it. For PyBP, I chose Minimal.
  * Edit content. I'll be doing this for a while. PyBP needs an index.md,
    so let's add that.
  * Once index.md is in place and pushed to the master branch, the top page
    is visible at https://tbarron.github.io/PyBP/.
    
All that's left to do is hack the actual content into what I want.

    Update (2018.0913): Actually, the Best Practices book should go someplace
    like readthedocs.org.
