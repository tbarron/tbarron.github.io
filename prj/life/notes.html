        <p class="nt-para">Conway's Life processes determinsitic automata. Each
          pixel is "alive" or "dead". If it's alive, it is set to black,
          otherwise white. At each iteration, a pixel comes to life or stays
          alive if it has three living neighbors. It stays alive if it has two.
          Otherwise, it dies.

        <p class="nt-para">I don't like how fuzzy the points are with drawing 1
          x 1 rectangles. I like the display I was getting back over in tusculum
          where we were using background colors on td elements in a table to
          turn cells on and off. I'm thinking I want to go back to doing it that
          way.

          <h4>2022.0302.w</h4>

        <p class="nt-para">I tried going back to the table approach and don't
          like how that's going. Sizing the td elements so they are
          approximately square seems to be problematic. Also, I found
          a <a href="https://medium.com/wdstack/fixing-html5-2d-canvas-blur-8ebe27db07da">reference
          for fixing the fuzziness when drawing on a canvas</a>. So I want to go
          back to using a canvas and apply the dpi_fix() function.
