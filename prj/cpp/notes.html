        <p class="nt-para">The Calories per Pound (cpp) app offers an easy
          way to convert food packaging information into an estimate of calories
          per pound for the food.

        <p class="nt-para">Placeholder for description of copying this app over
          from PA::tusculum and potential improvements to be made (eg., the idea
          of triggering calculations by losing focus on the input fields rather
          than by having to click a button)

        <h4>2022.0224</h4>

        <p class="nt-para">It seems cumbersome to force the user to move and
          press a "calculate" each time they want to compute a result. So I'm
          experimenting with triggering the calculation when control leaves the
          input fields.

        <p class="nt-para">When control leaves a field, we check whether enough
          info has been entered, and if so, we go ahead and run the appropriate
          calculation. That is,

          <pre>
            if the pink fields are full
               pkg_calculation()
            else if blue field has value
               wgt_calculation()
            else
               do nothing
          </pre>

          <p class="nt-para">So, the pink fields take precedence if both sets
            are filled in.

          <p class="nt-para">However, while this streamlines the operation for
            users who know what they are doing, it makes the computational
            trigger non-obvious, which may make trouble for users who don't
            realize that leaving the input fields trigger the calculation.

          <p class="nt-para">One way to help this might be to trigger the
            calculation when the user presses Enter. So I tried adding
            <i>onkeypress</i> as an event on the "body" element in the HTML
            file. That worked fine, but it didn't let me snag the event to see
            which key was pressed, so the code was reacting to every key press.
            Not what I wanted.

          <p class="nt-para">So I looked into adding a listener for
            the <i>keypress</i> event. It turns out that <i>keypress</i> has
            been deprecated in favor of <i>keydown</i> (per <a target="_blank"
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/keypress_event">
            this page</a>), so I switched over to that.

          <p class="nt-para">So far so good, but the current focus cycle just
            ranges over the four input fields. The user can enter values and
            perform computations from the keyboard, but they can't reset the
            fields without resorting to the mouse.

          <p class="nt-para">So let's add Reset to the focus cycle. I thought
            this meant I'd need to have the keyboard listener notice which
            element focus was sitting on when Enter is pressed to do the field
            reset if we happen to be on the Reset button, however it turns out
            that the default behavior in this case is just what is desired. So
            no special measures appear to be needed.

          <h4>2022.0226 09:30</h4>

          <p class="nt-para">To add a keyboard listener, we used window.onload
            in cpp.js to call initialize(). However, this masked the onload
            event to call show_update() coded in index.js, so our cpp pages were
            not getting the lupdate display.

          <p class="nt-para">The simple, unscalable, solution was to have the
            load handler in cpp.js (initialize()) add the keyboard listener,
            then also call show_update().

          <p class="nt-para">A better solution would be to find a way to build a
            list of load handlers. I looked for a way to do this as part of JS,
            but there doesn't appear to be one.

          <p class="nt-para">However, <a href="https://tinyurl.com/f2ptrfws">
            htmlgoodies.com </a> does offer a solution -- the function
            addLoadEvent(). Trying it in cpp.js now.

          <p class="nt-para">That is, I'm going to put the code for
             addLoadEvent() in index.js, use it there to install show_update()
             as a load handler, then call addLoadEvent() in cpp.js to add
             initialize() as a load handler and we'll see what we get.

          <p class="nt-para">And... it works great! I decided to call the
            function addLoadHandler() (instead of addLoadEvent). I can even call
            addLoadHandler() in index.js before it is defined, which surprises
            me, but makes it easy to put the load handler call right at the top
            of the file. Also, it works to code the handler function directly in
            the call to addLoadHandler(), rather than having to make the handler
            a separate, stand-alone function. For example,

            <pre>
   addLoadHandler(function () {
     document.addEventListener("keydown", keyHandler);
   })
            </pre>
