## Understanding Jekyll ##

This is the piece of documentation I needed last night to understand
how Jekyll is supposed to work.

What goes in _layouts and _includes and _css (or stylesheets) is
presentation formatting material.

Content goes in markdown (or textile, or whatever) files in the root
of the repository (and for blog entries, in _posts).
